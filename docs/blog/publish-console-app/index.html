        <h3>First, some context</h3>

<p>We use Github as our git versioning platform, so it made sense to use the repo releases feature to provide 
versioning for plugins. So to create a release you have to create a tag then create an archive based off that tag. It's basically 
like a savepoint for your code.</p>

<p>Sounds easy enough right? However, we had to hook into the Wordpress API in our plugins to check for updates 
in our respective repositories. Our solution was to have an <code>info.json</code> file on the master branch that would have have all the relevant 
up-to-date information required for a plugin update notification.</p>

<p>In that case, the whole <em>release</em> process includes updating the version number in the main plugin file and also updating 
this <code>info.json</code> file. Most of the times I used to forget to bump the version in the plugin file or write the wrong 
download url in the <code>info.json</code>. So we decided we should automate this using some sort of script.</p>

<h3>The tool</h3>

<p>From working with Gulp, a Javascript task runner, the first idea that came to mind was to write a task for this whole process. 
Though eventually, I ended up considering running a PHP script in the CLI running all the required tasks:</p>

<pre><code>- Bump the version in the plugin file
- Create a tag with the new version
- Push to the remote repo
- Using the Github Api, create a release
- Update `info.json` with the new download link
- Push modified `info.json` to master
</code></pre>

<p>For a whole week I went into a rabbit hole of how to run CLI processes from a PHP script and displaying the output in a decent way. 
I eventually landed on a Symfony Console Component. This made it even more easier and fun to create the mini dev tool.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fun fact: The Laravel command line tools are built from this Symfony Console Component</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tool made creating releases way faster and easier. Combined with standard guidlines like <a href="https://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a> 
the console application proved to be quite a valuable tool.</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>We use <em>composer</em> to manage the dependencies in our plugins. A good optimization strategy before shipping a composer project, is to 
generate the vendor folder without dev dependencies. The console app itself is run by dev dependencies, so 
running <code>composer install --no-dev</code>, would remove the app's dependencies leading it to fail.</p>

<p>So now we have to refactor the tool itself into another platform/language to allow composer optimization. We don't want to ship a bunch of 
files we never utilise in the plugins. Though the ideal way of doing this versioning and optimization is to use a CI/CD pipelining tool like 
Github actions. That's the next step for this tool.</p>

<h3>Source Code</h3>

<p>The tool is still pretty awesome, so I might consider extracting it into a package that also creates releases for non-wordpress projects. 
You can still check out the source code in any of our current plugins on Github under <code>console_app</code> directory.</p>
