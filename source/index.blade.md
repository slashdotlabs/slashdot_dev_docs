# What's this? {#what-this-is}

Think of this an an in-house platform for [Slashdotlabs](https://slashdotlabs.com) to document what happens in its projects, 
describe the learnings from various challenges and other aspects of a development cycle. Find out the amazing tools we adopt, 
and at times they are built by our own talent, to simplify our project development process.

# But why? {#but-why}

Well, if your new to the team, this is an awesome one-stop place to get a feel of what the team is about, how they operate 
and what tools they have been using.

Ever fixed a bug, but when you see get the bug again you can't remember how you fixed it? Well, now you have a reference point 
to solutions of recurring challenges that the team has already solved. __You're welcome :)__
